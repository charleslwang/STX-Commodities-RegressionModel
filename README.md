Stock and Commodity Market Prediction (minus the commodities aspect, which isn't implemented yet)
Overview
This project aims to predict the future performance of stock and commodity markets using historical price data. It leverages a basic linear regression model to forecast future prices based on past trends.

Features
Fetches historical market data for a given ticker symbol.
Processes and prepares the data for analysis.
Utilizes a linear regression model to predict future market prices.
Visualizes the historical data alongside the model's predictions.
Prerequisites
Before you run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
yfinance
You can install all required packages using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib yfinance
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Usage
To run the prediction model, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python main.py <TICKER_SYMBOL>
Replace <TICKER_SYMBOL> with the actual stock or commodity ticker symbol you wish to analyze (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, etc.).

Structure
main.py: The entry point of the application, handling command-line arguments and orchestrating the prediction workflow.
data_retrieval.py: Contains functions to fetch historical data for the specified ticker symbol.
data_preprocessing.py: Processes the retrieved data to make it suitable for model training and prediction.
model_development.py: Includes the machine learning model's training and prediction logic.
output.py: Responsible for displaying the results and plotting the historical and predicted prices.
How It Works
Data Retrieval: The program starts by fetching historical data for the specified ticker symbol.
Data Preprocessing: The fetched data is then cleaned and prepared for analysis.
Model Training: A linear regression model is trained using the preprocessed data.
Prediction: The trained model is used to predict future market prices.
Visualization: Finally, the results are displayed, showing both historical and predicted prices on a graph.
